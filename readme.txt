HUBO_GUI was built to demonstrate the forward/inverse kinematics and forward dynamics of the HUBO biped robot. 

To test this GUI, just run "HUBO_GUI. m". 

There are four modes---"Stand", "Swing", "Kick" and "Walking".

Please click "Stand" first to initialize.

Before switching from one mode (except "Stand") to another, please click "Stand" first to reinitialize the parameters.

Have fun...
